Remember that GitHub is NOT a support form! If you require user support with LifterLMS you will have more success in one of the following places:

- Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lifterlms
- Official Support Tickets: https://lifterlms.com/my-account/my-tickets
- LifterLMS Community Slack Channel: https://lifterlms.com/slack

You may also wish to peruse our documentation at https://lifterlms.com/docs

If none of these places seem appropriate ask away here.
